Echo Music Player Application:
An android music player application with features like shake to change, visualizer, mark as favorite and basic functionalities that a music player can provide. This Music Player App is made for learning to build User Interfaces, add Functionalities, Building Echo modules using Kotlin.

Build a music player with the following functionalities:

1.A Splash screen (gradient background and app logo in center)

2.A Navigation drawer with app logo section at the top along with links to ‘All Songs’, ‘Favorites’, ‘Settings’ and ‘About Us’.
3.An ‘All songs’ screen (where of list all the tracks fetched from offline storage are displayed and user can sort the tracks by name or recently added). This will the home screen of the app.

9.A ‘Now playing’ bar at the bottom with name of the track playing and play or pause feature. This would appear if the user has moved from ‘Now playing’ screen to ‘All songs’ screen or ‘Favorites’ screen without pausing the track.
10.Background play. The app will continue playing the track if the app gets closed (not killed) without the music being paused.
11.A notification saying "A track is playing in the background" only if the app gets closed (not killed) without the music being paused.
